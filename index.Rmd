## Welcome

This is the preparation and teaching material website for the GLEON 19 Machine Learning
workshop.

## Setting up R

First, we need to setup R and an editor for you. For R there is really no choice. For an R editor
there are many, but the most common to use is RStudio. 

Steps: 

1. [Download the latest version of R if you don't already have it](https://cran.r-project.org/). Install it. 
2. [Download the latest version of RStudio if you don't have it](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Install it. 
3. Verify that you can run RStudio. It should look something like the image below.

## Installing Needed Packages

We will use a wide variety of R packages today during the workshop. They will take a little bit of time 
to download and install, so go ahead and do that whenever you are ready. The core packages we will need 
are `dplyr, ggplot2, rLakeAnalyzer, randomForest, neuralnet, e1071`. The code below will download and 
install all of those core packages. Please copy-paste this code into your R console and run. 

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

install.packages(c('dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'rLakeAnalyzer', 'randomForest', 'neuralnet', 'e1071', 'caret'))


```
